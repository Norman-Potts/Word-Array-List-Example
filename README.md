# Word-Array-List-Example
  
  
The goal of this progam.
Count all the occurrences of words in a '"tale.txt". 
Store each word in lowercase format. 
A word will be considered to be one or more characters in length separated 
by white space (space character, the new line character). 
All commas, periods, exclamation points, question marks, and quotes are ignored.
Print an out put that answers the following. 

1. Total # of different words
2. Total # of words
3. The list of the 10 most frequent words and counts
4. The list of words that occur exactly 13 times in the file.
5. The # of different words that contain more than one 's'.
  
This program uses two classes, Main and Word. 
Word class is used to store each word. 
Main starts program, reads text file into an array-list of 'words', 
and process the output using the array-list.
       
This java project was created by Norman Potts.
Future improvements for the project will include organizing Main's  
method into methods to separate the procedures. 
Could also make multi threaded.
